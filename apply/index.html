  <p>I am using Atom Editor as my text editor to complete this assignment.</p>

  <p>Chapter provides an overview of webpage design and all of the design elements that must be taken into consideration when creating a webpage. Before you begin coding a website, you must first create a
  wireframe and site map. Next, you need to consider several design elements, such as graphics, navigation, and color. Finally, you must also plan for accessibility.</p>

  <p>After reading Chapter 1, I now understand how to download and use a text editor to create and HTML page. I know which elements are required to create a basic HTML webpage.</p>
